This life...
This is my longest night,
Never a star,
Never glistening moonlight,
To dream of the sun and its impossible warmth,
Was always an inconceivable dream,
I would settle for dimly lit stars and occasionally moonbeams,
I wrapped myself in obscurity,
Trusting the night to hide me from a daylight that would never come,
Longing for time to stand still,
But my anguish was unable to possess it,
Longing for morning to come,
To end this longest night.
